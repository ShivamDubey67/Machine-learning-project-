    "\n",

    "Linear Regression is a statistical technique which is used to find the linear relationship between dependent and one or more independent variables. This technique is applicable for Supervised learning Regression problems where we try to predict a continuous variable.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "Linear Regression can be further classified into two types – Simple and Multiple Linear Regression. In this project, I employ Simple Linear Regression technique where I have one independent and one dependent variable. It is the simplest form of Linear Regression where we fit a straight line to the data."

    "###  Simple Linear Regression (SLR)\n",

    "\n",

    "Simple Linear Regression (or SLR) is the simplest model in machine learning. It models the linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. \n",

    "\n",

    "In this project, there is one independent or input variable which represents the Sales data and is denoted by X. Similarly, there is one dependent or output variable which represents the Advertising data and is denoted by y. We want to build a linear relationship between these variables. This linear relationship can be modelled by mathematical equation of the form:-\n",

    "\t\t\t\t \n",

    "                 \n",

    "                 Y = β0   + β1*X    -------------   (1)\n",

    "                 \n",

    "\n",

    "In this equation, X and Y are called independent and dependent variables respectively,\n",

    "\n",

    "β1 is the coefficient for independent variable and\n",

    "\n",

    "β0 is the constant term.\n",

    "\n",

    "β0 and β1 are called parameters of the model.\n",

    " \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "For simplicity, we can compare the above equation with the basic line equation of the form:-\n",

    " \n",

    "                   y = ax + b       ----------------- (2)\n",

    "\n",

    "We can see that \n",

    "\n",

    "slope of the line is given by, a =  β1,  and\n",

    "\n",

    "intercept of the line by b =  β0. \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "In this Simple Linear Regression model, we want to fit a line which estimates the linear relationship between X and Y. So, the question of fitting reduces to estimating the parameters of the model β0 and β1. \n",

    "\n",

    " \n",

    "\n",

    "## Ordinary Least Square Method\n",

    "\n",

    "As I have described earlier, the Sales and Advertising data are given by X and y respectively. We can draw a scatter plot between X and y which shows the relationship between them.\n",

    "\n",

    " \n",

    "\n",

    "Now, our task is to find a line which best fits this scatter plot. This line will help us to predict the value of any Target variable for any given Feature variable. This line is called **Regression line**. \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "We can define an error function for any line. Then, the regression line is the one which minimizes the error function. Such an error function is also called a **Cost function**. \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "## Cost Function\n",

    "\n",

    "We want the Regression line to resemble the dataset as closely as possible. In other words, we want the line to be as close to actual data points as possible. It can be achieved by minimizing the vertical distance between the actual data point and fitted line. I calculate the vertical distance between each data point and the line. This distance is called the **residual**. \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "So, in a regression model, we try to minimize the residuals by finding the line of best fit. The residuals are represented by the vertical dotted lines from actual data points to the line.\n",

    "\n",

    " \n",

    "We can try to minimize the sum of the residuals, but then a large positive residual would cancel out a large negative residual. For this reason, we minimize the sum of the squares of the residuals. \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "Mathematically, we denote actual data points by yi and predicted data points by ŷi. So, the residual for a data point i would be given as \n",

    "\t\t\t\t\n",

    "                di = yi -  ŷi\n",

    "\n",

    "Sum of the squares of the residuals is given as:\n",

    "\n",

    "\t\t\t\tD = Ʃ di**2       for all data points\n",

    "                \n",

    "\n",

    "This is the **Cost function**. It denotes the total error present in the model which is the sum of the total errors of each individual data point. \n",

    "\n",

    "We can estimate the parameters of the model β0 and β1 by minimize the error in the model by minimizing D. Thus, we can find the regression line given by equation (1).\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "This method of finding the parameters of the model and thus regression line is called **Ordinary Least Square Method**.\n"
